# SPOJ CLASSICAL PROBLEMS SOLUTIONS 

This  is an inprogress repo that contains my solutions of the  SPOJ's classical problem-set sorted by number of submissions ( https://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/sort=6 ) using Java.

Many a times when I was stuck on a problem for several hours I got a cpp solution in the web but Java solutions are rare. So I am making this repository. I am targetting the first 200 problems as of now.

#### PS.  Please note that this solutions are no means perfect or made using best coding practices but nevertheless I have used easy to understand java operations and hopefully you would be able to understand.
